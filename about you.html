         I know a place. It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face. We get married in our heads, something to do while we try to recall how we met. Do you think I have forgotten? Do you think I have forgotten? Do you think I have forgotten about you?
You and I—we're alive. With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes. Wait, and pretend. Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end. Do you think I have forgotten? Do you think I have forgotten? Do you think I have forgotten about you?
And there was something about you that now I can't remember. It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender. And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning. I never know what to think about. I think about you. So don't let go. About you. So don't let go. Do you think I have forgotten about you? Don't let go. About you. About you.
